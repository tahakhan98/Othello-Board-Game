# Othello-Board-Game
Othello is the strategical board game.
This project helps to understand how the AI works.

Game Rules
1)Each piece played must be laid adjacent to an opponent's piece so that the opponent's piece or a row of opponent's pieces
is flanked by the new piece and another piece of the player's colour.
2)All of the opponent's pieces between these two pieces are 'captured' and turned over to match the player's colour.
